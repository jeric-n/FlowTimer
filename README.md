FlowTimer is a web application designed to help users practice the FlowTime Technique, a flexible time management method that encourages working in focused bursts and taking breaks as needed. Unlike rigid techniques like Pomodoro, FlowTime adapts to your natural work rhythm.

## Features

- **FlowTime Timer:** A customizable timer to track your focus and break periods.
- **Session Management:** Records and manages your work sessions locally.
- **Session History:** View a detailed history of your past focus and break sessions, including daily visualizations.
- **Data Import/Export:** Import and export your session data as CSV.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjust break timer presets to suit your workflow.

## The FlowTime Technique

The FlowTime Technique is a time management productivity technique by [Zoe Read-Bivens (Urgent Pigeon)](https://medium.com/@UrgentPigeon/abandoning-pomodoros-part-one-the-pros-and-cons-of-pomos-e3f3e9342ac9) that aims to address the pitfalls of the Pomodoro Technique while still focusing on tracking time, focusing on one task at a time, and taking breaks.

### Why FlowTime?

The Pomodoro Technique, with its fixed 25-minute work blocks and set breaks, can disrupt your flow state and create stress when unexpected interruptions occur or focus fades. FlowTime, in contrast, works *with* your natural rhythm, removing the pressure and guilt often associated with not fully utilizing a Pomodoro session.

### How to Use FlowTime

1. **Decide on a specific task that has an end.** Focus on one thing at a time.
2. **Click "Start Session".** This begins your focus timer. Start working on your chosen task.
3. **When you get interrupted or start getting distracted, click "Start Break".** This initiates a break timer.
4. **When you are ready, click "Resume Focus"** to start another focus timer.
5. **When the task is finished or you feel done for the time being, click "End Session".**

Your progress is recorded below the timer. View how productive you were for the day! Stats are tracked for each day and everything is saved locally on your device. Click on "All History" to see all your FlowTime sessions and details per day. You can download or load your FlowTimer data in here as well.
